Adds leave dates as events in a Google Calendar to keep track of employee leaves.

```sh
var calendarId = "c88fbb133b5079691394526aa9672144be327531938613d3ed3f7b4c70d6f281@group.calendar.google.com"; // Replace with your actual Calendar ID
  Logger.log("Using Calendar ID: " + calendarId);
  createCalendarEvent(calendarId, employeeName, leaveType, startDate, endDate, reason);
function createCalendarEvent(calendarId, employeeName, leaveType, startDate, endDate, reason) {
  Logger.log("Attempting to access calendar with ID: " + calendarId);
  var calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(calendarId);
  if (!calendar) {
    Logger.log("Calendar not found: " + calendarId);
    return;
  }
  Logger.log("Calendar found: " + calendarId);

  var eventTitle = leaveType + " Leave: " + employeeName;
  var eventOptions = {
    description: reason
  };

  Logger.log("Creating event with title: " + eventTitle);
